Control Windows Speech Recognition

This application, could be used by a C# programmer, as a starting point to using speech recognition to code by without having to buy Dragon. Provided they are happy to create lots and lots of commands as I have only scratched the surface.

Also to dictate with this application, you can optionally use Windows Azure, but you would need a subscription as the application requires a Speech Azure Key and a Speech Azure region entered into the app.config file.
