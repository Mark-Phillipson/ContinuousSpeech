# Coding By Voice Using Microsoft Azure Speech Recognition

Using Voice Commands With Microsoft Azure to Code By Voice

This application, could be used by a C# programmer, as a starting point to using speech recognition to code by without having to buy Dragon Professional Individual/Group. Provided they are happy to create lots and lots of commands as I have only scratched the surface.  I have concentrated on Visual Studio.

To dictate with this application, you use Microsoft Azure, but you would need a subscription as the application requires a Speech Azure Key and a Speech Azure region entered into the app.config file.

The application is a Windows Forms application, and is written in C#.

The application uses the Speech SDK for C#.

Note Microsoft Azure subscription includes a number of hours free per month, but you will need to create a subscription to get the key and region.

Most commands have been written into a database, and you can add your own commands fairly easily if they are just pressing keys in specific applications.
